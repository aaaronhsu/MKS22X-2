First, you have to read in the input. Store the map of the input a 2d int array we will call "board".
Read in each stomping instruction as (x, y). 
For each stomping instruction:
  Use a double for loop to loop through the mini rectangle from (x, y) to (x + 2, y + 2). Ignore the space if it is out of the bounds of the board.
  Record the largest number in the mini rectangle. Call this variable max.
  Loop over the mini rectangle again and update any value that is greater than (max - # of stomps) to be (max - # of stomps). If board[x][y] < 0, set it to be 0.
Loop through the board and calculate the aggregate depth of the board by adding (water depth - board[x][y]) to a running count if board[x][y] < water depth.
The answer is the aggregate depth * 5184.

Read in the input, storing whether or not a place is a wall using a 2d boolean array.
Create a 2d int array to hold the answer called "board", setting board[x][y] to 1 given that (x, y) is the starting coordinate.
Create a double for loop that runs t times.
  Clone ans to a temp 2d int array.
  If temp[x][y] > 0, then increment ans[x + 1][y], ans[x - 1][y], ans[x][y + 1], ans[x][y - 1] if such spaces exist and there isn't a wall there (use board[x][y]).
The answer is ans[finalXPos][finalYPos].
